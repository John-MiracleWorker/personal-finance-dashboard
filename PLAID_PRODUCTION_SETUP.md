# Connecting Real Bank Accounts with Plaid Production

To connect real bank accounts instead of test accounts, you need to upgrade your Plaid account to production mode.

## Steps to Enable Real Bank Connections:

### 1. Apply for Production Access
1. Log in to your Plaid Dashboard at https://dashboard.plaid.com
2. Navigate to "Team Settings" → "API"
3. Click "Apply for Production"
4. Fill out the application form:
   - Company information
   - Use case description (Personal finance management)
   - Expected transaction volume
   - Security practices

### 2. Complete Plaid's Requirements
- **Identity Verification**: Provide business documentation
- **Security Review**: Implement required security measures
- **Terms of Service**: Accept Plaid's production ToS
- **Approval Time**: Usually 1-2 business days

### 3. Update Your API Keys
Once approved for production:
1. Go to Plaid Dashboard → "Team Settings" → "Keys"
2. Copy your Production Client ID and Secret
3. Update your environment variables:
   - `PLAID_CLIENT_ID` = Your production Client ID
   - `PLAID_SECRET` = Your production Secret
   - Add `PLAID_ENV` = "production"

### 4. Update the Code for Production
The app needs a small update to use production environment:

```typescript
// In server/services/plaid.ts, update the configuration:
const configuration = new Configuration({
  basePath: PlaidEnvironments[process.env.PLAID_ENV || 'production'],
  baseOptions: {
    headers: {
      'PLAID-CLIENT-ID': process.env.PLAID_CLIENT_ID,
      'PLAID-SECRET': process.env.PLAID_SECRET,
    },
  },
});
```

## Important Notes:

- **Costs**: Production access has usage-based pricing (typically $0.25-$0.50 per linked account per month)
- **Compliance**: You must comply with financial data regulations
- **Security**: Implement proper encryption and data protection
- **Support**: Production accounts get access to Plaid support

## Alternative: Development Mode
If you just want to test with your own accounts:
- Plaid offers "Development" mode (free for up to 100 accounts)
- Limited to your own accounts and invited testers
- Good for personal use or small-scale testing

Would you like me to help you update the code for production mode once you have your production API keys?

## Current Production Issue: Data Transparency Messaging

### Problem
Your production credentials are working, but the Plaid interface freezes at phone number entry. This is because production accounts require Data Transparency Messaging configuration.

### Solution - Fix in Plaid Dashboard

**Step 1: Access Your Plaid Dashboard**
1. Go to https://dashboard.plaid.com
2. Log in with your production account

**Step 2: Configure Data Transparency Messaging**
1. Navigate to **Settings** → **Compliance**
2. Look for **Data Transparency Messaging** section
3. Complete ALL required fields:
   - **Privacy Policy URL**: Your app's privacy policy
   - **Terms of Service URL**: Your app's terms of service  
   - **Data Use Description**: How you use banking data
   - **Consumer Permissions**: What permissions you request

**Step 3: Alternative Location**
If you can't find the Compliance section:
1. Try **Team Settings** → **Compliance**
2. Complete the **Data Transparency Messaging** configuration
3. Save all changes

**Step 4: Test After Configuration**
Once you save the configuration:
1. The phone number entry will work properly
2. Bank connection will complete successfully
3. You can link real bank accounts

### Why This Happens
Plaid requires production accounts to inform users about data usage. Without this configuration, the interface freezes at phone verification to prevent data collection without proper disclosure.
